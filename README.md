# Part 3 - Retail Analytics Clustering & Customer Segmentation

* **This notebook is the continuation of "Part 2 - Cohort Based Retention Rate Analysis" project. It is the Part 3 of the analysis series based this dataset**

## RFM stands for Recency - Frequency - Monetary Value.
* **Low Value:** Customers who are less active than others, not very frequent buyer/visitor and generates very low - zero - maybe negative revenue.
* **Mid Value:** In the middle of everything. Often using our platform (but not as much as our High Values), fairly frequent and generates moderate revenue.
* **High Value:** The group we donâ€™t want to lose. High Revenue, Frequency and low Inactivity.

### Understanding The Segments
* **High Value:**  This segment include the customers who have purchased recently. There are customers who generate more revenue and are also frequent buyers. We can say it has our **Champions** or **Loyal Customers**. They are precious to the business and we should keep in touch with them.

* **Mid Value:** This segment include customers who have purchased items somewhat recently are moderately frequent and have generated moderate revenue. These customers will have new customers who recently started buying from us. This segment will also comprise of potential loyalists.

* **Low Value:** This is the most risky segment for the company as it comprises mostly of **Lost Customers or Hibernating Customers**. Most of the customers in this  group are not active as they didnt buy anything recently, not making much revenue for the company and also do not buy frequently.

### Recommendations 
* **High Value:**  Take feedbacks from the customers (use to improve business) . As this group is the most profitable for the company asking for their prefernces and personalize offers to keep them happy and satisfied. Focusing to retain them as loyal customers over years is top priority.

* **Mid Value:** As this group comprises of new customers as well , it is important to keep them engaged. Send incentivized offers to get more orders from this group.

* **Low Value:** This group has valuable customers who stopped transacting a long time ago. An attemp to re-engage them by sending crazy lucrative offers to get them back. Make them feel valued by sending personalized recommendations and offers based on their past purchase data
