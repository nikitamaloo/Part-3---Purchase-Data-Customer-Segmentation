# Part 3 - Retail Analytics: Clustering & Customer Segmentation

* **This notebook is the continuation of "Part 2 - Cohort Based Retention Rate Analysis" project. It is the Part 3 of the analysis series based on this dataset**

## RFM stands for Recency - Frequency - Monetary Value.
* **High Value:** The group we donâ€™t want to lose. High Revenue, Frequency and low Inactivity.
* **Mid Value:** In the middle of everything. Often using our platform (but not as much as our High Values), fairly frequent and generates moderate revenue.
* **Low Value:** Customers who are less active than others, not very frequent buyers/visitors and generate very low - zero - maybe negative revenue.

### Recommendations 
* **High Value:** Take feedback from these customers (and use it to improve business). As this group is the most profitable for the company, ask for their preferences and personalize offers to keep them happy and satisfied. Target them to join the Loyalty Program. Focus to retain them as loyal customers over years is top priority.

* **Mid Value:** As this group comprises new customers also , it is important to keep them engaged. Send them incentivized offers to get more orders from this group.

* **Low Value:** This group has valuable customers who stopped transacting a long time ago. Make an attempt to re-engage them by sending them crazy lucrative offers to get them back. Make them feel valued by sending personalized recommendations and offers based on their past purchase behavior.
